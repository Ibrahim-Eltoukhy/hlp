### What I learned

In this challenge I have learned to make my page responsive using media query and css grid, make my css file more organized and by using variables  


```css
:root {
  /* COLORS */
  --color-primary: #ff52bf;
  --color-sec-dark: #00252e;
  --color-sec-light: #808d99;

  /* Spaces */

  --section-margin: 100px;
  --section-padding: 50px;
}
```


### Continued development

The mobile first approach will be taken into account in the future projects also using css library like bootstrap also will be considered. 

### Useful resources
